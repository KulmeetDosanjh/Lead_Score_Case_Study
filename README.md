# Lead_Score_Case_Study
## Problem Statement
X Education, an online education company, faces a challenge with its lead conversion process, where only 30% of leads typically convert into paying customers. The company aims to improve efficiency by identifying the most promising leads, referred to as 'Hot Leads,' to enhance the lead conversion rate, with a target of achieving around 80% conversion.The current lead conversion process involves attracting professionals through various marketing channels, and once on the website, they may browse courses, fill out forms, or watch videos. Leads are classified when they provide contact details. The sales team then engages in communication, but the conversion rate is suboptimal.To address this, X Education seeks a model that assigns lead scores, allowing prioritization of potential leads. The idea is to focus efforts on leads with higher scores, increasing the likelihood of conversion. The ultimate goal is to streamline the lead conversion process, leading to a more efficient and successful customer acquisition strategy.
